Matt works on business and strategy, humanitarian collaborations, and bringing Mapbox to government.

Prior to joining Mapbox, Matt was a diplomat at the State Department where he mediated boundary disputes, supported regional peace talks, and liaised with rebel groups throughout the Middle East. Most recently he led State's Syria team and helped coordinate the intelligence community's Syria activities. In his spare time, Matt can be found road or cyclocross racing, playing the banjo, baking pies, or conducting oceanographic research in the fjords of British Columbia. He graduated from Northwestern University with a degree in philosophy and has lived in Kinshasa, Cairo, Jerusalem, and Damascus.
